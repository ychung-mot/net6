<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>
		Transportation Web Map (TWM) is a configurable template built on open source mapping technologies 
		that can be quickly deployed to provide spatial data visualization and discovery.
	</p>
	<p>
		Specific data may be presented as the primary focus of the map and additional functions added to 
		enhance the viewers experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additional spatial data from MoTI's web map services, as well as those of DataBC, may be searched 
		and added to the map.
	</p>
